âœ…1. Alarm Set:  Allowing users to set alarms using voice commands can be incredibly useful 
            for managing their schedules independently. Users should be able to specify the time, 
            repeat frequency, and perhaps even customize alarm sounds.

2. Medicine Text Recognition: This feature could utilize optical character recognition (OCR) technology 
            to recognize text on medicine labels or prescriptions. The assistant could then read out the 
            text aloud to the user, helping them identify their medications easily.

3. Wikipedia Search Facility:  Integrating Wikipedia search functionality into the assistant would provide users with a wealth of knowledge
                            at their fingertips. Users could ask questions or request information on various topics, 
                            and the assistant could fetch relevant Wikipedia articles or summaries.

4. Weather Updates: Provide users with real-time weather updates for their location. This can help them plan their outdoor 
                    activities and dress appropriately.

5. News Briefing:   Offer a feature where users can listen to brief news updates or headlines from reputable sources. 
                    This keeps them informed about current events without the need to read lengthy articles.

6. Voice Notes: Allow users to record and save voice notes for reminders, memos, or personal thoughts. 
                These notes can be accessed and replayed whenever needed.

7. Navigation Assistance: Integrate voice-guided navigation to help users navigate to different locations, 
                such as their home, work, or other saved destinations. This can be particularly useful for users who 
                are unfamiliar with their surroundings.

8. Calendar Integration: Sync the assistant with users' calendars to provide reminders for appointments, events, and tasks. 
                Users can add, edit, and manage their schedules using voice commands.

9. Currency Conversion: Enable users to convert between different currencies by simply asking the assistant for the exchange 
                rate or performing calculations.

10. Language Translation: Incorporate a feature that translates phrases or words into different languages. 
                This can help users communicate more effectively, especially when traveling or interacting with people 
                from diverse backgrounds.
